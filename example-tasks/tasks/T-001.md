      - [ ] Design database schema for n:n relationships
      - [ ] Implement backend API endpoints
      - [ ] Create frontend components for visualization
      - [ ] Write unit tests
      - [ ] Update documentation

    1 - Implement support for linking reconciliation groups with n:n relationships
    between multiple data sources.
    
    **Context:**
    Currently the reconciliation system works with 1:1 or 1:n relationships
    between sources. However, there are cases where we need to relate multiple
    transactions from one source with multiple transactions from another source.
    
    **Use case examples:**
    - 2 transactions from source A to 1 transaction from source B
    - n transactions from source X to n transactions from source Y
    - Multiple sources related in a single group
    
    **Requirements:**
    1. Allow a reconciliation group to contain transactions from multiple sources
    2. Support n:n (many-to-many) relationships between transactions
    3. Maintain traceability of which transactions are related
    4. Update reconciliation engine to support multiple sources per group
    5. Update frontend interface to visualize groups with multiple sources
    6. Ensure matching algorithms consider all involved sources.
