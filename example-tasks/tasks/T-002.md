  - steps:
      - [ ] Identify different data types and their structures
      - [ ] Map variations by data type
      - [ ] Update extraction script to detect data type
      - [ ] Implement specific parsers for each type
      - [ ] Add type field in extracted data
      - [ ] Test extraction with different types
      - [ ] Document supported types

    Implement extraction of data considering different source types.
    
    The current system extracts data generically, but there are different
    source types that generate data with different structures, especially for:
    
    - **Type A**: Different formats depending on source type
    - **Type B**: Different formats depending on source type
    
    It is necessary to:
    1. Identify and catalog the different source types used
    2. Map the differences in data structure for each type
    3. Adapt the extraction script to detect and process
    each type correctly
    4. Ensure extracted data maintains consistency regardless of
    source type
    5. Add metadata about data type in extracted records to
    facilitate traceability and debugging
    ```
