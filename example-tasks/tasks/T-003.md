  - steps:
      - [x] Extract codes from sample data
      - [ ] Identify all relevant codes
      - [x] Query transactions from external API
      - [ ] Manually validate codes in external transactions
      - [ ] Generate validation report with found/not found codes
      - [ ] Document which fields correspond to codes
      - [x] Validate matching between internal and external data
    ```md
    Validate if the codes present in the source data exist in external API transactions.
    
    This task involves:
    - Extracting codes from sample data
    - Querying external API for matching transactions
    - Validating code matching between systems
    - Generating reports for validation results
    - Documenting field mappings
    ```
