# T-004

  - steps:
      - [x] Review how dates/times are extracted and stored
      - [x] Ensure all extracted times are converted to UTC before saving
      - [x] Update time field to always contain complete datetime in UTC
      - [x] Standardize time extraction to convert to UTC
      - [x] Simplify formatting functions removing timezone conditionals
      - [x] Update date formatting to always assume UTC and convert to local
      - [x] Remove unnecessary fallback functions after standardization
      - [x] Update database utilities to use UTC and require this field
      - [x] Remove unnecessary fallbacks from frontend

    Completed (2025-12-23):
    
    **Complete standardization:**
    - All sources now generate `datetime_utc` correctly
    - Time calculations convert local time to UTC
    - Database utilities updated to use `datetime_utc` and require this field
    - Code no longer accepts records without `datetime_utc` (skips with warning)
    
    **Simplified frontend:**
    - Removed all conditional fallbacks for `datetime_utc`
    - Filters use only `datetime_utc`
    - Time extraction functions simplified (only `datetime_utc`)
    - Date/time formatting uses only `datetime_utc` (no fallback)
    
    **Result:**
    - Standardized system: all records have mandatory `datetime_utc`
    - Simpler code without unnecessary conditionals
    - Better performance: no fallback checks
    - Warnings in console if any record without `datetime_utc` appears
    ```
