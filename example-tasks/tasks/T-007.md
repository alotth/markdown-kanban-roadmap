  - steps:
      - [x] Identify all script imports in backend
      - [x] Port cert utilities to services
      - [x] Port extraction logic to services
      - [x] Port reconciliation engine to services
      - [x] Update database service to implement functions natively
      - [x] Remove all script imports
      - [x] Verify backend independence
    ```md
    Remove all imports of scripts from the `scripts/` directory within the backend,
    porting the necessary logic into `services/`.
    
    **Problem:**
    - Backend was importing functions directly from `scripts/`
    - This created circular dependency and made maintenance difficult
    - Scripts should be independent of the backend
    
    **Implemented solution:**
    1. **Cert Utils**: Created `services/cert_utils.py` with conversion functions
       - Removed import from scripts in credential service
    
    2. **Extraction**: Created `services/extraction_source.py`
       - Ported query logic and data mapping
       - Removed import from scripts in extraction service
       - Extraction now connects directly and saves via database service
    
    3. **Reconciliation**: Created `services/reconciliation_engine.py`
       - Ported complete reconciliation logic
       - Ported persistence functions
       - Removed import from scripts in reconciliation service
    
    4. **Database Service**: Updated `services/db_service.py`
       - Removed re-exports from scripts
       - Implemented functions natively
       - Maintained API compatibility
    
    **Verification:**
    - No imports from `scripts/` remaining in backend
    - Original scripts kept intact (not deleted)
    - Backend is now completely independent of scripts
    ```
